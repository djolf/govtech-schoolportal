# govtech-schoolportal
An education system

## Getting started
Clone the repo, then run:
```
npm install
```
at the root folder. This should install both client and server.
Then run:
```
npm start
```
to run both client and server. Uses port 3000 by default, so go to http://localhost:3000/ to access the app.
